Let me be completely honest with you: I really don't know anything about networks. But I'm documenting my learning journey because I believe there's value in sharing the struggle, the confusion, and the small victories that come with learning something new.

## Starting from Absolute Zero

When I say I don't know anything about networks, I mean it. A few weeks ago, I couldn't tell you the difference between a router and a switch. I didn't know what an IP address really was beyond "that number thing computers have." The OSI model? TCP/IP? Complete mysteries to me.

But you know what? That's okay. Everyone starts somewhere, and I'm starting here, right at the very beginning.

## The Overwhelming Feeling

The first time I tried to read about networking, I felt completely overwhelmed. There are so many acronyms, so many concepts, so many things that seem to build on other things I don't understand yet. It's like trying to read a book where every other word is in a foreign language.

But instead of giving up, I decided to embrace being a beginner. There's something liberating about admitting you don't know something and giving yourself permission to learn it slowly.

## My First Small Victories

Here are some tiny wins I've had so far:

- **Understanding what "ping" does** - It's like saying "hello" to another computer to see if it's there!
- **Learning about IP addresses** - They're like postal addresses for computers
- **Figuring out what a subnet is** - Kind of like neighborhoods for IP addresses
- **Understanding the basic idea of protocols** - They're like languages computers use to talk to each other

These might seem trivial to experienced network engineers, but for me, each of these was a small "aha!" moment that made me want to learn more.

## What I'm Learning Right Now

Currently, I'm trying to wrap my head around:

- How routers actually decide where to send data
- The difference between Layer 2 and Layer 3 (still confusing!)
- Why there are so many different types of cables
- What VLANs are and why they're useful

I'm taking it one concept at a time, trying not to rush ahead before I understand the basics. It's tempting to try to learn everything at once, but I've learned that leads to confusion and frustration.

## My Learning Strategy

Here's what's working for me so far:

1. **Start with the absolute basics** - Don't skip the fundamentals
2. **Use analogies** - Comparing network concepts to real-world things helps me understand
3. **Draw diagrams** - Visual learning works better for me than just reading
4. **Don't be afraid to ask "dumb" questions** - There are no dumb questions when you're learning
5. **Practice with simple tools** - I started with basic ping and traceroute commands

## The Plan Moving Forward

I know I have a long way to go. My goal isn't to become a network expert overnight, but to build a solid foundation and gradually expand my knowledge. I want to understand the "why" behind networking concepts, not just memorize facts.

Next, I'm planning to:
- Set up a small home lab with virtual machines
- Practice subnetting (this still makes my head spin)
- Learn about basic routing protocols
- Understand how DNS actually works

## Why I'm Sharing This

I'm documenting this journey because I think there's value in showing the learning process, not just the end result. Too often, we only see the polished knowledge of experts and forget that they all started as beginners too.

If you're also starting your networking journey, know that it's okay to feel confused. It's okay to not understand things at first. It's okay to go slow. The important thing is to keep going, keep asking questions, and keep learning.

And hey, if I can figure this out, starting from absolutely nothing, then anyone can!
